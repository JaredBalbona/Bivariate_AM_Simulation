## Multivariate Simulation of Human Population Growth

----

### Broad Summary:

These scripts collectively simulate the genetic and phenotypic development of a human population over a user-specified number of generations. In doing so, they are able to account for non-random mating between parents, and environmentally mediated parenting effects.

The mathematical expectations in these scripts are largely taken from [previously published work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-020-10032-w) by our research group in which we used structural equation modeling to estimate familial effects. However, this simulation offers a vectorized implementation of the math from our prevoius publication, allowing us to model many many more relationships without becoming computationally intractable. 

For further information on the math involved— including some principles multivariate path tracing, descriptions of the matrices used, and explanations for why matrices are diagonal vs. symmetric vs. full, please see [our guide on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vjvshhnmfcdq).
